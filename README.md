# Eat Da Burger
This an application that can be used to log the burgers you'd like to try and the ones you've eaten! 

The app is an example of using the MVC Paradigm with a homemade ORM to manipulate a MySQL database. 

This app is also the first use of Express Handlebars we've had. 

To use the application, merely enter in the submit box any burgers you would like to try in the future. Following this, if you do end up eating any of those burgers, press the button next to the burger to mark it as "devoured".
